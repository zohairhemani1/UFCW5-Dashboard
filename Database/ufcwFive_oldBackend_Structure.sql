(154, 'UFCW President Hansen Statement in Response to President Obamas Executive Action on Immigration', 'WASHINGTON, D.C. Joe Hansen, International President of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), today released the following statement in response to President Obama plan to take executive action on immigration. Today the President announced he will take belated but necessary action to provide relief to immigrant workers, families, and communities. Make no mistake this is not a substitute for comprehensive immigration reform. But it will prevent the deportation of many immigrants who would have qualified for citizenship under the Senate bill that passed over 500 days ago.For nearly a year and a half, the House Republican leadership has refused to take action to fix our broken immigration system. The President has both a legal right and moral responsibility to step in. At the UFCW, this has been our fight for decades. Our members and their families have persevered through raids and deportations. UFCW members have mobilized to defeat racist ballot initiatives and our union has assisted workers with the legalization process while negotiating contracts that protect our members where the law fails to. All along, those in UFCW gold have lobbied for comprehensive immigration reform at protests, marches, rallies, town halls, and just yesterday, in front of the White House. We will continue to call on Congress to send legislation to the Presidents desk. But with no bill to sign, President Obama is rightly using his pen to provide relief to those who are trying to make a better life for themselves and their families. Executive action is not all we need or deserve. But it is a step in the right direction and for that we are thankful. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) represents more than 1.3 million workers, primarily in the retail and meatpacking, food processing and poultry industries. The UFCW protects the rights of workers and strengthens Americas middle class by fighting for health care reform, living wages, retirement security, safe working conditions and the right to unionize so that working men and women and their families can realize the American Dream. For more information about the UFCWs effort to protect workers rights and strengthen Americas middle class, visit www.ufcw.org, or join our online community at www.facebook.com/UFCWinternational and www.twitter.com/ufcw.image002', '28dd2c7955ce926456240b2ff0100bde.png', '2015-02-12 06:34:34', 'member', 1, '', '', '', '', 'on', 2),

At well-attended gatherings, that started Sunday and concluded Wednesday evening, members voted by 99% to oppose give backs to the company.\r\n\r\nOriginally meetings were set with the membership to vote on a last best and final offer made by the company. When word was received from the international union requesting Local 5 hold off on a strike/ratification vote the local changed the vote to an advisory referendum on the last, best and final offer. The request by the international is provided for in article 23 of the constitution and the local agreed to the request. Additionally, the company claims the last, best and final offer was withdrawn. Since the offer was supposedly withdrawn Local 5 has made a request for additional bargaining dates under the auspices of the Federal Mediation & Conciliation Service (FMCS) to conclude bargaining. A meeting is in the process of being set with the federal mediator and company when all the principals can attend.\r\n\r\nThanks go out to all members who attended and made their voices heard.

An estimated 4.1 million people should qualify for this program.\r\n&#61623; The existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program will be expanded and now will cover people who entered the U.S. before their sixteenth birthday and have lived continuously in the U.S. since January 1, 2010. People who were “aged out” of DACA by being older than age 31 on June 15, 2012, are now eligible to apply, regardless of how old they are now. Approximately 300,000 people will be benefit from these changes.\r\n&#61623; Certain spouses of lawful permanent residents may be able to get their lawful permanent resident (“green card”) status through a waiver process. Spouses of U.S. citizens are currently able to apply through this process.\r\nHeres what you can do: \r\n&#61623; Even if you are eligible for these programs, you cannot apply for them yet! The government expects that it will start accepting applications within three months from now for those eligible for expanded DACA, and within six months from now for those eligible for DAP.\r\n&#61623; Do not take advice about your immigration case from a notary public or an immigration consultant. Contact only a qualified immigration lawyer or an accredited representative for legal advice about your case. If you encounter notario fraud, report it!\r\n&#61623; If you know someone who is in immigration detention and is eligible for one of these programs, advise them to identify themselves to their case officer, or the ICE Information Line at 888-351-4024, and explain that they are eligible for one of these new programs.\r\n&#61623; If you believe you are eligible, begin preparing now by gathering documents that prove:\r\n that you were in the U.S. yesterday (on November 20, 2014),\r\n that you have been in the U.S. since January 1, 2010, and\r\n that you have a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident son or daughter.\r\n(Read our Top Ten Ways You Can Prepare for Executive Action on Immigration.) \r\n&#61623; Stay informed and sign up at www.nilc.org/relief.html to receive updates.

In 1976, the celebration was officially recognized and expanded and every U.S. president since then has celebrated Black History Month during the month of February.\r\nOne of the greatest moments of the Civil Rights era was the March on Washington in 1963 one of the largest non violent protests to ever occur in America. The March on Washington brought thousands of people of all races together, in the name of equal rights for everyone whether they were black or white, rich or poor, Muslim or Christian. Dr. Marin Luther King, Jr. made one of his most inspiring and famous speeches at the march, which culminated on the National mall.\r\n\r\nBut history has often overlooked the man who was the driving force behind this monumental event a man namedBayard Rustin. Rustin was the one who organized the march, bringing methods used by Gandhi as well as the Quaker religion to Washington to ensure peace, but also impact. It was Rustin who helped shape Dr. King into the iconic symbol of peace he is remembered as.\r\n\r\nAs a young adult, Rustin worked with many kinds of people who influenced his activism, including ministers and labor organizers.
